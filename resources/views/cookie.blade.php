    <p>
        As is common practice with almost all professional websites this site uses cookies, which are 
        tiny files that are downloaded to your computer, to improve your experience. This page describes 
        what information they gather, how we use it and why we sometimes need to store these cookies. 
        We will also share how you can prevent these cookies from being stored however this may downgrade 
        or 'break' certain elements of the sites functionality.

            How We Use Cookies
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately in most cases there are no 
        industry standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and 
        features they add to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure 
        whether you need them or not in case they are used to provide a service that you use.

            Disabling Cookies
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser 
        Help for how to do this). Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and 
        many other websites that you visit. Disabling cookies will usually result in also disabling certain 
        functionality and features of the this site. Therefore it is recommended that you do not disable 
        cookies. This Cookies Policy was created with the help of the 
        <a href="https://www.cookiepolicygenerator.com/cookie-policy-generator/">
            Cookies Policy Generator from CookiePolicyGenerator.com
        </a>.

            <p>
                If you create an account with us then we will use cookies for the management of the signup process 
                and general administration. These cookies will usually be deleted when you log out however in some 
                cases they may remain afterwards to remember your site preferences when logged out.

            <p>
                We use cookies when you are logged in so that we can remember this fact. This prevents you from having 
                to log in every single time you visit a new page. These cookies are typically removed or cleared when 
                you log out to ensure that you can only access restricted features and areas when logged in.
